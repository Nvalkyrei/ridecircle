# Ride Circle - Technical Assumptions & Decisions

## Key Assumptions Made

### 1. Business Model Assumptions
- **Primary Market**: Urban India (Tier 1 & 2 cities)
- **Target Audience**: Tech-savvy users aged 25-45
- **Revenue Model**: Commission-based (15-20% per transaction)
- **Growth Strategy**: City-by-city expansion with franchise model

### 2. Technical Assumptions
- **User Base**: 100K users in first year, scaling to 1M+
- **Concurrent Users**: 10K peak concurrent users
- **Transaction Volume**: 1000+ bookings per day at scale
- **Data Growth**: 1TB+ annually including media files

### 3. Regulatory Assumptions
- **KYC Requirements**: Aadhaar-based verification mandatory
- **Insurance**: Third-party integration with major providers
- **Tax Compliance**: Automated GST calculation and filing
- **Data Residency**: All data stored within India

### 4. Integration Assumptions
- **Payment Gateways**: Razorpay as primary, Stripe as backup
- **Maps**: Google Maps API for location services
- **SMS/OTP**: Twilio or similar service for notifications
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS for infrastructure, Vercel for frontend

## Technology Decisions Rationale

### 1. PostgreSQL over MongoDB
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as primary database
**Rationale**:
- ACID transactions critical for financial operations
- Complex relational data (users, cars, bookings, payments)
- Better audit trail capabilities for compliance
- Mature ecosystem for analytics and reporting
- JSON support provides flexibility when needed

### 2. Microservices Architecture
**Decision**: Implement bounded context-based microservices
**Rationale**:
- Independent scaling of different services
- Team autonomy and faster development cycles
- Technology diversity where appropriate
- Fault isolation and better resilience
- Easier compliance auditing per service

### 3. Multi-Tenant Strategy
**Decision**: Schema-per-tenant with shared infrastructure
**Rationale**:
- Data isolation for franchise operations
- City-specific customizations and compliance
- Independent scaling per market
- Revenue tracking per franchise
- Regulatory compliance per state/city

### 4. Security Architecture
**Decision**: JWT with rotating refresh tokens + RBAC
**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication for scalability
- Fine-grained access control
- Mobile app compatibility
- Industry standard security practices
- Compliance with financial regulations

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Read replicas, connection pooling, query optimization
- **API Rate Limits**: Redis-based rate limiting, circuit breakers
- **Data Loss**: Automated backups, point-in-time recovery
- **Security Breaches**: Multi-layer security, regular audits, incident response plan

### 2. Business Risks
- **Regulatory Changes**: Modular compliance layer, regular legal reviews
- **Market Competition**: Rapid feature development, strong user experience
- **Fraud Prevention**: ML-based fraud detection, manual review processes
- **Insurance Claims**: Comprehensive documentation, third-party integration

### 3. Operational Risks
- **Service Downtime**: Multi-region deployment, health checks, auto-scaling
- **Data Compliance**: Automated data retention, encryption, access logging
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Multiple provider options, fallback mechanisms
- **Team Scaling**: Clear documentation, standardized processes, code reviews

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Single city deployment (Mumbai)
- **Phase 2**: Multi-city expansion (5 cities)
- **Phase 3**: Pan-India presence (20+ cities)
- **Phase 4**: International expansion consideration

### 2. Technology Evolution
- **AI/ML Integration**: Dynamic pricing, fraud detection, recommendation engine
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time vehicle tracking, condition monitoring
- **Blockchain**: Transparent transaction records, smart contracts
- **Mobile-First**: Progressive Web App, native mobile applications

### 3. Compliance Evolution
- **Data Protection**: Enhanced privacy controls, consent management
- **Financial Regulations**: Real-time transaction monitoring, automated reporting
- **Environmental**: Carbon footprint tracking, electric vehicle incentives
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, multi-language support
